# Matlab-Tools
Really useful functions I have made which make matlab so much easier to use

Numerical:
Interpolate.m	: *capital I* returns interpolated value give two pieces of data and a given input between them
interpolatedata.m	: interpolates a single value between an entire set of input and output data
tridiagonal_matrix_generate.m : : generates a tridiagonal matrix of constant values in the diagonals

Chemical Engineering Specific:
cp_correlation.m	: Uses the common chemical engineering Cp correlation to calculate Cp for substances given data and T
delA.m	: Linearly finds A, B, C, D values for the cp correlation for a mixture
AntoinesPout.m	: Returns Antoine's equation saturated pressure for given temperature
AntoinesTout.m	: Returns Antoince's equation temperature for given saturated pressure
